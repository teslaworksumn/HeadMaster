Animatronic Barbershop Quartet Main Heads Controller
====================================================

What's going to happen:
* We are going to first try using inline assembly for parsing our DMX
* If that doesn't work, we'll attempt to use inline assembly for our I2C control (some simple modifications)
* Also, I (@tylrtrmbl) think that we could study the assembly DMX parsing and implement that in C too
